## Generated/Fake Data for the database
### Overview
- The data is generated by running  `datagen.py`, which writes the data for each table into a correspondingly named CSV file. 
- The CSV files will be used to populate the fake data into the database.

### More on data generation
- TODO: enforce any data quality specifications (ie. mentee email and parent email should not be the same, logical restrictions on transaction dates)
- In each CSV file, the column names make up the first row. This is necessary for SQLAlchemy to be able to parse the file (match each column in the file to each column in the schema)
- For each table, the column names, and the order that the columns are written in datagen.py, must match with model.py, again for SQLAlchemy to parse correctly.  
- Presently, the ids follow the SQL "Generated by Default as Identity" structure of starting by 1 and then incrementing by 1 each time. This can be changed if there are security concerns.
